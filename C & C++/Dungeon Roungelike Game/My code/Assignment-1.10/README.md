Most human beings strongly believe that money is way less important than
the life of a human being, but in reality five hundred, fifty, or even 
five dollars are way more important to the lives of most human beings 
than the lives of most human beings

The symbol for gold is "$". So, now they will be created and randomly places on the map just like the other object. At the beginning of the game, the player will have 0 gold. The player need to pick up the gold to be able to buy item from the store. Every dungeon level will or will not have a store. The store is randomly place on the map and only in a room. The symbol of a store is '^'. To enter the store, the player need to step on the store and input '^'. Then , the store will randomly generate 3-6 item from the desctiion list. every store will have different item. And the player only allow to buy on item from the store. The purchsed item will added into the player's inventory. The store will also disappear after the player purchase one item or leave the store without pruchasing. The price of each item is set according to their rarity, so the price will be higher if their rarity is higher. 

Apart from that, we have added a better stair system. If we go up the stair, the monster is getting stronger and vice versa.
