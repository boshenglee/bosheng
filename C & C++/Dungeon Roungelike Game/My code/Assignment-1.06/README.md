For this assignment, we have modified our code to support c++. The make file is now using g++. Apart from that, we have fixed some errors when converting from c to c++. Also, I have changed all struct to class. The default fog of war or current vision is bold. Its very difficult to differentiate between unbold and bold one, so I have added blue and italic on top of the bold one.
