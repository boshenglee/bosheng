This project contains all necessary functionality. Grains are dropped in the center of the map, then radiate out in the cardinal directions when they become unstable. <br />
* `initializeSandPile` creates the base sandpile <br />
* `outputSandPIle` outputs the sandpile and creates a new line after every iteration <br />
* `topple` handles unstable sand piles and topples the sandpile and disperses the sand <br />
* `line 32 - 43` handles the fps input <br />
* `line 79 - 86` is the infinite loop that handles the fps calculation and calls all of the other functions <br />
