# CY_02 Hello World

According to George Miller, our mind can only store approximately 7 items in our short term memory. That is why we always forget to buy something from the store. Moreover, the grocer also purchases items that are not necessarily in his life. Our LetsGro Android application will help a person to be a successful grocer. Who is a victorious grocer? Someone who managed to buy all of the items that he needed, not too little nor too much. The LetsGro Android allows users to keep track of how much money they have and if they are spending the money at where they should be using the analysis function.
The main page will have five sections, which are History, To-Buy, Analysis, Receipt, and Add Receipt (with a camera and OCR). History is where the users can view the receipt and information from the past; To-Buy is the place for the users to make lists for things they need to purchase; Analysis is for the users to view the statistics of stores, items, and prices that they like or been to the most; a receipt is a place to store all the receipt from the past; last, Add Receipt is where the users can take pictures with their cameras to add receipt into Receipt. Users can click on the items to edit and to view details, they can also select to get a notification before N hours. The default for N hours is Â½ hours but users can customize N.
